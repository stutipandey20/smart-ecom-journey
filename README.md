# Smart Product Recommendation + Wishlist Flow

## Overview

This project implements a feature that enhances the e-commerce customer journey by tracking user interactions such as viewed items and wishlist additions to:

- Recommend similar or trending products
- Show “Recently Viewed” and “You May Also Like” sections
- Provide instant wishlist summaries with helpful reminders

## Why It Matters

- **Awareness:** Engage users with relevant product recommendations  
- **Consideration:** Allow users to save items for later via wishlist  
- **Decision:** Use nudges like “Almost sold out” to encourage purchases  
- **Retention:** Send reminders or promo suggestions based on wishlist activity  

## Tech Stack & What I'll Learn

- **React.js:** Building reusable UI components and managing state  
- **React Router:** Implementing page navigation  
- **Tailwind CSS:** Styling components with utility-first CSS framework  
- **State Management:** Using React State and Context API for interaction tracking  
- **Data Persistence:** Leveraging `localStorage` to save user data across sessions  
- **Mock APIs:** Using JSON or static files to simulate backend data  
- **Node.js & Express (optional future):** Creating backend APIs and server-side logic  
- **Databases (optional future):** MongoDB or Firebase for persistent storage  
- **Caching (optional future):** React Query or Redis to optimize data fetching and performance  

*Optional future improvements:* 
Add backend APIs with Node.js/Express, real database integration (MongoDB, Firebase), and caching with React Query or Redis.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `npm install`  
3. Run `npm start` to launch the app  

## Features to Build

- Product recommendation and wishlist components  
- Interaction tracking with React state/localStorage  
- Navigation between homepage, product details, and wishlist pages  

## Project Roadmap

- Phase 1: Frontend-only with React, Tailwind, and localStorage  
- Phase 2: Mock backend using JSON data  
- Phase 3: Real backend with Node.js and database  
- Phase 4: Add caching and performance optimizations
